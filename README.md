# Weather Forecast App

This project is an application that displays the current weather conditions in the user's location based on the user's input and recommends Spotify playlists that could match the vibes of those conditions. The app utilizes the Open Weather Map API to retrieve real-time weather data and the Spotify API to fetch playlists and generate music recommendations that match the user's mood and the weather conditions. It is developed using Java for the backend logic and parsing of the APIs, while HTML and JavaScript are used for the frontend design.
