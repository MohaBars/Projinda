# Weather Forecast App

This project is an application that displays the weather condition in a selected city of the userâ€™s choice. Based on the weather, a playlist on Spotify will be recommended that will match the mood of the weather. The app utilizes the Open Weather Map API to retrieve real-time weather data and the Spotify API to fetch playlists and generate music recommendations that match the user's mood and the weather conditions. It is developed using Java for the backend logic and parsing of the APIs, while HTML and JavaScript are used for the frontend design.
